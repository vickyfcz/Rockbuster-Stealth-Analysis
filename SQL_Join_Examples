This SQL query identifies the top 10 countries by customer count. Using **INNER JOIN** clauses, it connects the customer, address, city, and country tables. It then counts and orders customers by country, displaying the top 10 with their respective counts.


SELECT 
	D.country
	COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM 
	customer A
INNER JOIN 
	address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN
	city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN
	country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY
	D.country
ORDER BY
	customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

This SQL query retrieves the top 10 cities within the 10 countries with the most customers. It uses a subquery with **INNER JOIN** clauses to first identify those countries, then selects the top 10 cities located in those countries based on customer count. The final output displays each city and its corresponding customer count.

SELECT 
    C.city,
    COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM 
    customer A
INNER JOIN 
    address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN
    city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN
    country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE
    D.country IN (
        SELECT 
            D.country
        FROM 
            customer A
        INNER JOIN 
            address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
        INNER JOIN
            city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
        INNER JOIN
            country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
        GROUP BY
            D.country
        ORDER BY
            COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
        LIMIT 10
    )
GROUP BY
    C.city
ORDER BY
    customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
